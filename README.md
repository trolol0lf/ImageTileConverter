# Image Tile Converter 1.0

This is the current Version of my "Image Tile Converter"

It is a small tool to generate one image from four. Nothing more!



You can drag, drop, zoom the Images to make compositions of 4 Images and convert it to one final image with scalable Resolution.



Just use the ./dist/ImageTileConverter.exe and you should be good! Or look around in the Project; it's nothing special
